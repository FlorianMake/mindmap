Ideas about the mindmapping tool:


- an general overview shall be available of all mindmaps 
	- A allready added mindmap looks like a rectangle with an screenshot about the current state or if pretty large with an clip
	- click on a mindmap for selection an opening one mindmap
	- option for deleting the mindmap
		- safety request
	- option to add a new mindmap
		- view with all options for new mindmap 
			- Name
			- folder for storage
			- description
	


- Handling a Mind Map 
	- adding new items -> node like items
	- moving items around 
	- the map shall be dragable or movable
	- the background must show the movement
	- webpage as a link or screenshot as a overview
	- simple drawing funktions
		- rectangle
		- combination of nodes with different tips (arrow, point, etc.)
		- line styles (dotted lines)
		- curved lines (besier line?!)
	- grouping of items
		- add a border or group around different items (with color for background)
	
	
	
- Reminder as background tool
	- add some meetings to the calendar
		- recurring cycling and so on...
	
	
		
-Look and feel
	- light mint green background
	- pastel colors would be nice
	- slightly round corners and thin light grey edges
